                                The SYRIOS Project began in 2016 both as an outgrowth of research into
                                ancient Syria and in response to the current crisis within the modern
                                region. By focusing on the dynamic presentation of Syrian material
                                culture and the stories of its cities within the Greco-Roman period,
                                we seek to:

                              This current exhibit serves as Phase I and “Proof of
                              Concept” for the overall project. It focuses on the
                              history of the Syrian capital city of Antioch and the
                              concept of studying coins as pieces of art and objects
                              that move. From a technical perspective, this initial
                              exhibit provided a platform for investigating overall
                              design, interactivity, and usability.

                              city of Antioch. This phase will include additional
                              animations, themed stories, an interactive timeline,

                            While Dr. Lindner’s background is in engineering, she has built her career
                            around data science education and digital humanities at UH since 2014
                            and has a keen appreciation of the importance of making data free and
                            accessible to everyone. She received her Ph.D. from the University of
                            Stuttgart in 2007, where she researched the management of applications
                            from science and engineering in heterogeneous grid environments. Trained
                            in High Performance Computing, she infuses all her projects with higher
                            expectations for quality and stability, while her expertise in data
                            representation has made it possible to think about larger and more
                            integrated data projects. She has extensive experience with students as
                            a co-director of the Data Analytics in Student Hands (DASH) project and
                            as a teacher in the Computer Information Technology program. She currently
                            serves on the Advisory Council for the Digital Research Commons at UH.

                            Rodwell’s background combines design production/research, technology
                            studies, and anthropology. Before returning to graduate school to get
                            an M.A. and Ph.D. in anthropology, she was an Assistant Professor of
                            Computer Graphics and New Media at Johnson & Wales University for six
                            years. During this time, she earned an M.A. in Media Studies, and one
                            in Social Sciences at the University of Chicago. Her Ph.D. work at Rice
                            University examined the ways that Japanese television is experimenting
                            with interactivity, and the imbalance between technological innovation
                            and content censorship in Japanese mass media. After earning her Ph.D.
                            in 2015, she was employed in the business world as a usability
                            researcher – to learn how social scientific methods could be used to
                            enhance technological development. In 2019 she joined the faculty of
                            UH as an Assistant Professor of Digital Media, in the Information &
                            Logistics Technology department. Her book manuscript is titled, <em>Push
                            the Button: Interactive Television and Collaborative Journalism in Japan. </em>
                            Rodwell will be joined in this project by a student research assistant
                            to help lead usability testing, and will be assisted by students in
                            her senior-level UX course.
